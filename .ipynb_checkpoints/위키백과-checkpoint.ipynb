      "[1. 내용] Losing Chase is a 1996 American drama film made for television, directed by Kevin Bacon in his directorial debut.[3][4]  The screenplay was written by Anne Meredith. Set in Martha's Vineyard, it stars Helen Mirren, Kyra Sedgwick and Beau Bridges. Losing Chase had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996.[5][6]\n",
      "\n",
      "[2. 내용] Produced for the Showtime network,[7] it was broadcast on August 18, 1996.[2]  After receiving a generally positive reception it was given a limited theatrical release in December.  Losing Chase was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "[3. 내용] Following a nervous breakdown and upon returning home following treatment, Chase Phillips (Helen Mirren) is hired a helper, Elizabeth (Kyra Sedgwick) by her husband, Richard (Beau Bridges). Chase is opposed to being given a helper and treats both her husband and Elizabeth with contempt. Chase snidely asks Elizabeth what she plans to do with the money she earns from being a helper; Elizabeth replies that she is not doing it for the money. Chase's two young sons, Little Richard (Michael Yarmush) and Jason (Lucas Denton), are returned to the family home the same day Elizabeth arrives. The youngest son, Jason, is eager to see his mother but Little Richard treats her with hostility.\n",

His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brother-in-law, Carlos. Walter's apartment is just across the street from an elementary school—an obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki, one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying \"I didn't hurt them.\" Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond, Walter tells her to leave his apartment.\n",

Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin who is a birdwatcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy, but does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious coworker, Mary-Kay, learns of his conviction.

As she starts to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father. In her anguish, and sensing a similarity between her father and Walter, she offers to sit on Walter's lap, wanting his approval. Walter finally understands the pain he caused his victims, and tells Robin to go home; as she leaves, she gives him a hug. On his way home, he sees Candy dropping off a young boy near the school at night. In a fit of rage and self-hatred, Walter beats Candy up. He then goes to Vicki's home, and she accepts him.\n",
